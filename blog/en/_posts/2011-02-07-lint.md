My belly button has always produced lint, it's a white, soft, and warm guest, she lives there, sometimes at night we talk.., and I realize we like the same things, we ask the same questions and sometimes we even get the same conclusions. This make me think about the possibility of had been a little lint in the belly button of someone else in a previous life.
