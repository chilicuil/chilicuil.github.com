Lastly I've been wondering why some music tones are so sticky, with this in mind, I've enrolled and finished "[Introduction to Classical Music](https://class.coursera.org/introclassicalmusic-001)" on Coursera (which I totally recommend) and read about how musical notation and notes work.

It turned out than a piano is quite useful when learning these matters, unfortunately I don't own one and have no plans to get any soon, so I decided to emulate it. Sadly there are few alternatives when it comes to Linux, so I decided to go my own with a minimalist approach and that's how pianocat was born.

<pre class="sh_sh">
$ #basic tone
$ echo "D4 F4 - G4 A4 - A#4 A4 G4 - E4 C4 - D4 E4 F4"   \
  "- D4 D4 - C#4 D4 E4 - C#4 C#4 - D4 F4 - G4 A4 - A#4" \
  "A4 G4 - E4 C4 - D4 E4 F4 - E4 D4 C#4 - C#4 D4 - - D4" | pianocat

$ #a more elaborated version of the previous melody
$ echo "T:4/4 L:1/4 D4 F4:2 ! G4 A4:2 ! A#4:.5 A4:.5"     \
  "G4:2 ! E4 C4:2 ! D4:.5 E4:.5 F4:2 ! D4 D4:2 ! C#4:.5"  \
  "D4:.5 E4:2 ! C#4 C#4:2 ! D4 F4:2 ! G4 A4:2 ! A#4:.5"   \
  "A4:.5 G4:2 ! E4 C4:2 ! D4:.5 E4:.5 F4:2 ! E4:.5 D4:.5" \
  "C#4:2 ! C#4 D4:2 - D4:4" | pianocat
</pre>


[Pianocat](https://github.com/chilicuil/learn/blob/master/sh/tools/pianocat) can also be used in interactive mode:

The sounds is quite bad, but it works so I'm leaving it like this for now. Thanks to the sox developers and to [ssshake](https://github.com/ssshake) for the initial snippet.
