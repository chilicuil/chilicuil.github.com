I've been using [i3-wm](http://i3wm.org) for a year, it's fast, configurable and l33t, so I don't have intentions to change it. Nevertheless I decided to update it, here is how I did it in Ubuntu:

<pre class="sh_sh">
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:minos-archive/main
$ sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install i3-wm
</pre>

My [~/.i3/config](https://github.com/chilicuil/dotfiles/blob/master/.i3/config.4) configuration file &#128522;
