During these days I read about [howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi), a [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) client for your [terminal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface). I think it's pretty cool, so I looked at a couple of implementation (the [original](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi) in python and a [clone](https://github.com/roylez/howdoi) in ruby) and decided to do my own version, I've just learned awk and wanted a pretext to use it.

You can get the code at:

Happy hacking &#x263a;!
