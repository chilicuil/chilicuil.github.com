For one reason or another I find more reliable remote people, I mean, whatever I make a new friendship it's almost always the case that if I made it online it will last more time, I suppose that's because when you're behind a screen, your acts are premeditated, you think better what you say, and how to react to what people say to you. There are no "I'm moving somewhere else", because there is no place without Internet!, and you depending on your internet addiction you can even end talking more with them than with other local people.

Nothing, I appreciate online partners &#128524;
