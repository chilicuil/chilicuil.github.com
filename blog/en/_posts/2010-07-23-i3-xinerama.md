**Update Feb/2014: ** I've created a [dmenu script](https://github.com/minos-org/minos-tools/blob/master/tools/dmenu-xrandr) who lists and configures automatically available monitors.

One of the main reasons I decided to stick with [i3-wm](http://i3-wm.org) over [wmii](http://wmii.suckless.org/) was the improved [xinerama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinerama) support, that is the hability to use several screens at the same time, can you believe there are some window managers who don't do it?, me neither &#128563;

For example, if I were to clone the video output from my laptop screen to a video projector I could use:

<pre class="sh_sh">
$ xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1024x768 --same-as LVDS1
</pre>

Or if were to extend my virtual work place, I could execute:

<pre class="sh_sh">
$ xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1024x768 --right-of LVDS1
</pre>

**xrandr** accepts plenty of options, refer to the man page for more details.
