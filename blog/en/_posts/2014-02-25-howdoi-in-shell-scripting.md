During these days I read about [howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi), it's a [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) client, it allows you to fetch answers for your technical questions from your [terminal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).  It's a nice idea, I had already read about similar tools, for example utilities which allow you to query google, to translate, or to order pizza, some of them are actually useful, others well...

I think this is one is pretty cool, so I looked at a couple of projects (the [original](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi) in python and a [clone](https://github.com/roylez/howdoi) in ruby) and decided to do my own version, I've just learned awk and wanted a pretext to use it.

You can get the code at:

Happy hacking &#x263a;!
