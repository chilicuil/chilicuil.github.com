I hate banks!, today I lost my morning trying to use paypal through my [banorte](http://www.banorte.com/) account, however at the end I was able to buy my gift for [Mwkdoll](http://mwkdoll.blogspot.com/) =)! (a domain name) I hope she like it, she is one of the smartest girls I know…, I’ve also found a little jewel “[meu cativeiro entre os selvagens do brasil](http://www.estantevirtual.com.br/formaseletras/Hans-Staden-Meu-Cativeiro-Entre-os-Selvagens-do-Brasil-48243284)” (my captivity among the savages of Brazil) from “hans staden”, I’ve looked at most of the biggest libraries here and I’ve only found 2 portuguese books, this one in the street for only 1 dollar!! yeeei.

Good luck!
