I’m scratching my whole body, I like to do it because it feels sooooo goood, I deserve it after a sort of busy weekend, Saturday was finally the UGJ, it wasn’t as cool as I though but it was really bad either, I will definitely … do it again, and I hope Akemi can do it as well, she made a little concession at her blog (calling me ‘my love’), =3 and also she was the only one who was there during all the event Vn_nV..  On Sunday I went to see ‘de panzazo‘  a film about the educational system in México.

Today prepared my homework for tomorrow’s html classes and registered a domain for the school where I work, dunno why I didn’t do it before, it’s cheap enough to have to wait for ‘authorization’…
