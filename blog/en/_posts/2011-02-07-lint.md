My belly button has always produced lint, it’s a soft, warm and white one, she lives there, although use to play around, sometimes at night we talk.., and we realize we like the same things, we ask the same questions, and even sometimes we have the same conclusions, I guess than in my previous life I had to have been lint in the belly button of someone else…
