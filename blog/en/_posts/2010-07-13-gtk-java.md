One of the main reasons I don't like java is how their applications looks, whenever I open a java program I've the sensation I've gone back to the past 10-15 years. Nevertheless some of those applications can be forced to use gtk when available:

<pre class="sh_sh">
export _JAVA_OPTIONS="-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.defaultlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.gtk.GTKLookAndFeel"
</pre>

It can also be permanently set by copying it to **~/.bashrc** or your favorite shell configuration file.
