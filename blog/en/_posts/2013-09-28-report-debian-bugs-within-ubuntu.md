I'm a normal computer user, I don't run local mail servers and I don't have the intention to do so, I have my email account with gmail and I review it using a web browser or [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) when I'm in my own computer. This can be troublesome if you pretend to report bugs to [debian](https://www.debian.org/) using its [bug tracker system](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/) an antique system based in emails.

To report a bug from within Ubuntu, people are suppose to type:

<pre>
$ reportbug -B debian package
</pre>

However it won't work because it won't find a local mail server (and it would let you know after you spend 15-20 min, smart programming &#128530;) After spending more precious time on Internet, you'll find out it actually can be configured to use an external smtp server (I've read somewhere Debian devs are interested in upgrade BTS, and probably they will re-invent the wheel in the process because of course there are not enought bug trackers online)...

<pre>
$ reportbug --configure
</pre>

And you'll need to input the following data:

- smtp.gmail.com:587
- user@gmail.com
- check tls

After done it a new **$HOME/.reportbugrc** file will be created and the original command would work.

<pre>
$ reportbug -B debian package
</pre>

### extra

If your report contain patches, and after configuring **reportbug** it may be a good idea to use **submittodebian** instead:

- It adds ubuntu specific [tags](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Debian/Usertagging)
- Allow patch editing before sending the report (to remove Ubuntu changes)
- Use internally reportbug to send messages

**submittodebian** only works when you've *.orig, .diff, .changes* files, these files are generated by [debuild](http://man.he.net/man1/debuild).

### examples

#### apt-get source (traditional)

<pre>
$ apt-get source xicc
$ cd cd xicc-0.2/
$ sed -i 's/colour/color/g' debian/control
$ dch -i 'debian/control: replaced "colour" with "color".'
$ debuild -S
$ submittodebian
</pre>

#### bzr (modern)

<pre>
$ bzr branch lp:ubuntu/xicc
$ cd xicc
$ sed -i 's/colour/color/g' debian/control
$ dch -i 'debian/control: replaced "colour" with "color".'
$ bzr commit -m 'replaced "colour" with "color".'
$ bzr bd -- -S
$ submittodebian
</pre>
