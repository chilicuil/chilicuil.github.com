I don't consider myself a programmer but a sort of power user, I'm in love with the cli linux interface and everytime I can automatizate repetive tasks I do it. That's how I ended writting [60~ scripts](https://github.com/chilicuil/learn/tree/master/sh), after a while I noticed a pattern, I used to copy and paste some parts of other scripts to finish faster so I started to write functions and put them in a lib file. After a while it has been increasing and I thought it would be a good idea to share it and see if it can be useful to someone else, so here it is.

- [sh/lib](https://github.com/chilicuil/learn/blob/master/sh/lib)

If you can improve current functions or add new ones you are welcome (just branch and push back), be aware that current code may hurt your eyes, you've been warned.
