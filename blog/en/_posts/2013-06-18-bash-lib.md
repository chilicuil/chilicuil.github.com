I don't consider myself a programmer but a sort of power user, I'm in love with the cli linux interface and everytime I can automatizate repetive tasks I do it. That's how I ended writting [60~ scripts](https://github.com/chilicuil/learn/tree/master/sh) (most of them for fun, others for sysadmin work), while doing it I noticed a pattern, I used to cheat and copy some part of other scripts to finish faster so I started to write functions and put them in a lib file. After a while it has been increasing and I thought it would be a good idea to share it and see if it can be useful to someone else, so here it is.

- [sh/lib](https://github.com/chilicuil/learn/blob/master/sh/lib)

If you can improve current functions or add new one, your contribution is welcome (just branch and push back), beware that current code may hurt your eyes, you've been warned.

Have fun
