For one reason or another I find more reliable remote people, I mean, whatever I make a new relationship it\u2019s almost always the case that if I made it online it will last more time, I guess that\u2019s because when you\u2019re behind a screen, your acts are premeditated, so you think better what to say, and how to react to what people say to you. There are no excuses like \u201cI\u2019m moving somewhere else\u201d, because there is no place without Internet! =), and people sometimes get to know you better that local friends, I imagine than that's the case because when you\u2019re relax at your computer you may be confident enough to share what you'd hide to anothers.

Nothing, I appreciate online partners =)
