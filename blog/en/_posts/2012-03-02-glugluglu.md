Today was a great day!, I wasted most of it getting ready for our local [UGJ](http://www.google.com.mx/search?q=ugj&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a#sclient=psy-ab&hl=es-419&client=firefox-a&hs=600&rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&source=hp&q=ubuntu+global+jam&pbx=1&oq=ubuntu+global+jam&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=41109l44615l1l44826l21l12l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0l0&gs_l=serp.3...41109l44615l1l44826l21l12l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&fp=b9a92e3288493079&biw=1362&bih=623) living in a enormous city has its advantages like getting everything setup almost instantly =), I just left some papers unprinted, I’ll do it tomorrow, right now it’s time to get off my clothes and dance [salsa](http://www.google.com.mx/search?q=salsa+genre&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a), love it, my nail lint today suggested me to act like fish at random times and see people’s face, it was funny xD.
