I've been using [i3-wm](http://i3wm.org) for a year, it's fast, configurable and l33t, so I don't have intentions to change it. Nevertheless I decided to grab a more recent version (&lt; 4), add some [patches](http://i3wm.org) and freeze it. This version is intend to be used in all supported Ubuntu LTS versions. Feel free to install it as well.

<pre class="sh_sh">
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:minos-archive/main
$ sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install i3-wm
</pre>

For completion, this is the [~/.i3/config](https://github.com/chilicuil/dotfiles/blob/master/.i3/config.4) configuration file I use and how it looks
