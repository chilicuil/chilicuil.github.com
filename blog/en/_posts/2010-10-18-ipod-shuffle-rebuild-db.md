Some time ago I bought an ipod shuffle and as with all apple products it turned out to be somekind difficult to use on Linux. Rythmbox and gtkpod sometimes do weird stuff, so I keept testing projects till I found [rebuild_db](http://shuffle-db.sourceforge.net/), a minimalist program who just get the job done &#9731;

After connecting and mounting the device (it only works with shuffle models) you can create any directory (I call it 'music') and copy there all your tracks. At the end before unmounting just execute the program and it would rearrange the files and will create the expected structure. I'm now a happy ipod shuffle user &#128526;
