My belly button has always produced lint, it's a soft, warm and white lint, she lives there, sometimes at night we talk.., and I realize we like the same things, we ask the same questions and sometimes we even have the conclusions. This make me think that probably in a previous life I should had been a lint in the belly button of someone elseâ€¦
