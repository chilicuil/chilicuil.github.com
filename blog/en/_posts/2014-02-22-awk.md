The other day while I was browsing I found an article called "[The awk origens](http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/216844/a-z_programming_languages_awk/)", I liked so much than I decided to learn awk (it's pronounced "auk"). I don't consider myself a programmer but I often write simple [scripts](https://github.com/chilicuil/learn/tree/master/sh/tools) to automatize my daily chores. When I do it, I prefer using shell scripting because of its easy to use, portability, simplicity and performance (believe it or not, cut, awk, sed, grep etc are usually faster than perl or python in short scripts).

I used to use awk to print fields in strings and nothing else, I considered larger awk programs too complicated and didn't understand why people claimed awk was easy to learn and use. To be fair I've never meet locally any person proficient in awk. Most of my influences come from Internet where awk seems like a popular language. Was I just too stupid to understand it?, were they just too intelligent?. Turned out it was none. Awk is truly an easy to use and learn language, its syntax could be better though.

Also in awk (and sed) most unix commands can be emulated; cut, cat, uniq, tail, head, etc, this fact helped me to keep reading documentation till it made sense. It did and I discovered than besides been simple it's really fast!, let's review an [example](https://github.com/chilicuil/shundle/commit/9f5fdcbd3bb8976d93a7bb8d3b9f647ec8bade9e):

<pre class="sh_sh">
$ time (sed -n '/bundle\/shundle/,$ p' .bashrc | egrep '^.*=[^;&amp;]*' | sed -e '/#.*=/d')
real	0m0.06s
$ time (awk '/bundle\/shundle/,0 {if ($0 ~ "^.*=[^;&amp;]*" &amp;&amp; $1 !~ "^#") print }' .bashrc)
real	0m0.03s
</pre>

It takes half the time!, and the difference gets bigger when more pipes are added:

<pre class="sh_sh">
$ time (sed -n '/bundle\/shundle/,$ p' .bashrc | egrep '^.*=[^;&amp;]*' | sed -e '/#.*=/d' | \
        sed '/Bundle=/!d' | sed -e "s:Bundle=::g" -e "s: ::g" -e "s:['|\"]::g")
real     0m0.09s
$ time (awk '/bundle\/shundle/,0 {if ($0 ~ "^.*=[^;&amp;]*" &amp;&amp; $1 !~ "^#") { if ($0 ~ "Bundle=") \
  { sub(/Bundle=/,""); gsub(/'\''/,""); gsub(/'\"'/,""); print $1 } } }' .bashrc)
real     0m0.03s
</pre>

Even if the performance were the same, the logic is simplified.

## Awk, an event drive language

The most important thing in awk (and what took me more time to learn) was to understand that it's an event drive language, it's hard to learn because most common languages are not. It's structured in 5 important areas:

- **begin**
- **body**
  - **search**
  - **action**
- **end**

This means every awk program (even the smallest ones) have a begin, body and end sections. The begin and end sections are similar, they're executed only once, at the beginning and at the end of the program, not big deal. To write the classic "Hello World" program a person can do it in both sections:

<pre class="sh_sh">
$ awk 'BEGIN {print "Hello World"}' &lt; /dev/null
Hola mundo
$ awk 'END   {print "Hello World"}' &lt; /dev/null
Hola mundo
</pre>

Every section is defined by its name and its actions (which are defined between {}). Awk programs are written between (') so the shell doesn't interpret any variable or key word. Awk programs can also be written in files and be executed directly:

<pre class="sh_sh">
$ cat hello.awk
#!/usr/bin/awk -f
BEGIN {print "Hello World"}
$ ./hello.awk
Hello World
</pre>

The body section is however the most powerful section, it defines search patterns and related actions.

<pre class="sh_sh">
$ awk '/.*/ {print $0}' file
</pre>

The above line is comparable to **$(cat file)**, the search pattern is **/.\*/** (any character) and the action is **{print $0}** (print current line). The body section is executed 1 time per line, if a file contain 10 lines, the body section will be executed 10 times and will print all the content. Any length of pattern-actions can be declared within an awk program. The next example will look for **daemon** and **root** and will print every line where awk finds those strings.

<pre class="sh_sh">
$ awk '/root/ {print $0} /daemon/ {print $0}' /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
</pre>

If no search pattern is defined for an action, the action will be executed once per line, if no action is defined for a search pattern the default action will be print the current line, if no parameter is given to **print** it will print the whole line (**$0**). Therefore the above examples can be rewritten as follows:

<pre class="sh_sh">
$ awk '{print $0}' file
$ awk '{print}'    file

$ awk '/root/ || /daemon/ {print $0}' /etc/passwd
$ awk '/root/ || /daemon/ {print}'    /etc/passwd
$ awk '/root/ || /daemon/'            /etc/passwd
</pre>

These alternatives ways of writing awk programs (I think) are part of the reason why awk seems like a cryptographic language. Awk also defines default variables, not knowing them will make you going nuts. Some of the most important are:

>NR = Number of Record (line number)

>NF = Number of Field

>RS = Record separator (\n by default)

>FS = Field separator  (white spaces by default)

If you've a file with this content:

<pre class="lyric">
1 2 3
4 5 6
</pre>

Awk will see 2 records and 3 fields. After learning how awk scan files, let's review how emulate **$(cat -n file)**:

<pre class="sh_sh">
$ awk '{print NR, $0}' file
</pre>

Since the search pattern is missing, the action will be executed for every line, and for every time it will print **NR** plus the whole line, **NR** will increase +1 in every iteration, as you probably noted, awk uses a comma "," to concatenate strings. Let's review other example, **$(wc -l)**:

<pre class="sh_sh">
$ awk 'END {print NR}'      file
$ awk '{i++} END {print i}' file
</pre>

**NR** will always increment, so in the first program when the END sections gets executed it will print the total amount of lines in the file. The second example is easier to analyze, it doesn't have a search pattern so the action (i++) will always be executed and at the end the program it will be printed, let's emulate now **$(head)**:

<pre class="sh_sh">
$ awk 'NR &lt;= 10'          file
$ awk -v hl=10 'NR &lt;= hl' file
</pre>

Does it make sense?, awk is not as difficult as it seems &#128521;. Sed can also be emulated:

<pre class="sh_sh">
$ awk '{gsub(/original/,"replace"); print}' file
$ awk 'function sed(search, replace) { gsub(search,replace); print } {sed("search","replace")}' file
</pre>

Awk can use control structures and functions, in the first example it uses de gsub function to replace all original string with "replace" in a file, just as sed would do it. In the second one, a function called "sed" is defined and used to replace the same strings. Awk is a complete language, and it would take a long time to analyze every feature it supports. Nevertheless if you've read till this phrase you already know its core principles and it shouldn't take too much extra effort to understand it. Don't despair, awk may seems scary at the begging but it's a powerful ally to destroy those kilometric one liners &#128521;

I'll leave some more examples, can you guess how do they work?

## Awk as Unix swiss army knife

<pre class="sh_sh">
cat file                 &#x25B7; awk '{print}' file
cat -n file              &#x25B7; awk '{print NR, $0}' file
cat -n file              &#x25B7; awk '{print FNR, $0}' file
head file                &#x25B7; awk 'NR &lt;= 10' file
head -15 file            &#x25B7; awk -v hl=15 'NR &lt;= hl' file
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd  &#x25B7; awk -F":" '{print $1}' /etc/passwd
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd  &#x25B7; awk 'BEGIN {FS=":"} {print $1}' /etc/passwd
wc -l file               &#x25B7; awk '{i++} END {print i}' file
wc -l file               &#x25B7; awk 'END {print NR}' file
wc -w file               &#x25B7; awk '{ total = total + NF }; END { print total+0 }' file
grep pattern file        &#x25B7; awk '/pattern/' file
grep -v pattern file     &#x25B7; awk '!/pattern/' file
sed 's/foo/bar/g'        &#x25B7; awk '{gsub(/foo/,"bar"); print $0}' file
tail file                &#x25B7; awk -v tl=10 '{a=a b $0;b=RS;if(NR&lt;=tl)next;a=substr(a,index(a,RS)+1)}END{print a}' file
tail - 15 file           &#x25B7; awk -v tl=15 '{a=a b $0;b=RS;if(NR&lt;=tl)next;a=substr(a,index(a,RS)+1)}END{print a}' file
tac file                 &#x25B7; awk '{a[i++]=$0} END {for (j=i-1; j&gt;=0;) print a[j--] }' file
uniq file                &#x25B7; awk 'a !~ $0; {a=$0}'
</pre>

## Awk one-liners

<pre class="sh_sh">
awk '1; {print ""}' file                     #adds double space
awk 'BEGIN { ORS="\n\n" }; 1' file           #adds double space
awk 'NF {print $0 "\n"}' file                #adds double space to lines with content
awk '{print $NF}' file                       #print last field of every line
awk 'NF > 4' file                            #print lines with more than 4 fields
awk '{ sub(/^[ \t]+/, ""); print }' file     #delete white spaces at the beggining of a line
awk '{ sub(/[ \t]+$/, ""); print }' file     #delete white spaces at the end of a line
awk '{ gsub(/^[ \t]+|[ \t]+$/, ""); print }' #delete white spaces at the beggining and end of a line
awk '{$2=""; print}'                         #delete the 2nd field of every line
awk '/AAA|BBB|CCC/'                          #search and print "AAA", "BBB" or "CCC"
awk '/AAA.*BBB.*CCC/'                        #search and print "AAA", "BBB" and "CCC" in that order
</pre>
